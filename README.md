## Dev Instructions for python scripts
You will need to have `python3`, `pip` and `pipenv` for development

under `./pyScripts` create a new terminal and run `pipenv install` to create a virtual env and install dependencies from Pipfile

when installing packages for the project, use `pipenv install <package_name>`

use `pipenv run <command>` to run sth inside the virtual env

after installing packages, run `pipenv run pip freeze -> requirements.txt` to generate requirements.txt
