                                RobotA came to Hong Kong for its studies. Due to the covid regulations it has to
                                quarantine for 2 weeks. It cost it a lot of money and it feels very lonely after the
                                first week has passed. And because of the time difference to its home country Robota can
                                hardly contact its friends, because they are at work when it has free time. Luckily,
                                Robota has a friend in Hongkong, who is also put under quarantine. They are texting a
                                lot with each other, and share the things they can observe trough their window.

                                RobotB is a local robot, whose friend was tested positive with Covid. Now, she also
                                needs to quarantine, as a preventative measure. Although the shared flat she inhabits is
                                rather large, her room is very small and he is not allowed to leave it. Anyways Robob is
                                not missing out too much, because the whole city is locked down. However, she is
                                extremely bored, because she cannot perform her job online, and therefore has nothing to
                                do, except looking out the window and texting her friend Robota, who is also under
                                quarantine.
